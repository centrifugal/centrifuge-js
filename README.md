========================================

See client [documentation](https://fzambia.gitbooks.io/centrifugal/content/clients/javascript.html)

### Contribute

If you want to contribute, install dependencies and run `gulp` command from root repo folder - this results
in creating build file in `build` directory.

After work done you can build unminified (`centrifuge.js`) and minified (`centrifuge.min.js`) bundles on top repo level using `npm run build` command.
